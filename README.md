# SJF-Scheduling-Visualiser
I Made This Project In 5th Semester Of Our College

# SJF Scheduling Visualizer 🚀  
A web-based tool to visualize **Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU Scheduling Algorithm** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

## 🔹 Features  
✔️ Interactive UI to input process details (arrival time, burst time, etc.).  
✔️ Supports **Preemptive & Non-Preemptive SJF Scheduling**.  
✔️ Visual representation of process execution in a Gantt Chart.  
✔️ Calculates **Turnaround Time, Waiting Time, and Average Time**.  
✔️ Real-time scheduling simulation.  

## 📌 How It Works  
1️⃣ Enter the number of processes and their details.  
2️⃣ Choose **Preemptive or Non-Preemptive** mode.  
3️⃣ Click **Start** to visualize scheduling.  
4️⃣ View calculated metrics and Gantt Chart.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for styling  
- **JavaScript** for logic & visualization  

## 🎯 Future Enhancements  
🔹 Add support for more scheduling algorithms (FCFS, Round Robin, etc.).  
🔹 Improve UI/UX with animations and real-time updates.  
🔹 Allow users to upload process data from CSV files.
